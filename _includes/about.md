Hello! I’m Pete, a product manager based in Brisbane, Australia. With a passion for building impactful digital products, I spend my days coordinating cross‑functional teams to turn great ideas into user‑centric solutions.

In my free time I enjoy exploring the outdoors, learning new technologies, and sharing knowledge with others. This page serves as a brief introduction to who I am and what drives my work.
